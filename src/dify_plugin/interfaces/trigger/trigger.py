        Implementation guidelines:
        1. Extract necessary IDs from subscription.properties (e.g., external_id)
        2. Use credentials and credential_type to call the external service
           API to delete the webhook
        3. Handle common errors (not found, unauthorized, etc.)
        4. Always return UnsubscribeResult with detailed status
        5. Never raise exceptions for operational failures. Use
           UnsubscribeResult.success=False.
        6. Return `UnsubscribeResult(success=True, ...)` when the external service
           unambiguously reports that the subscription is already absent.

        Args:
            subscription: The Subscription object with endpoint and properties fields

        Use this when:
        - A subscription is approaching expiration (check expires_at timestamp)
        - You want to keep the subscription active with the same settings
        - The subscription properties need to be updated routinely

                        For unauthorized auth, there is no credentials.

        Internal method to implement subscription refresh logic.

        Subclasses must override this method to handle simple expiration extension.

        Implementation patterns:
        1. For webhooks without expiration (e.g., GitHub):
           - Update Subscription.expires_at=-1 so Dify will never call this
             method again

        2. For lease-based subscriptions (e.g., Microsoft Graph):
           - Use Subscription.properties to call the service's lease renewal
             API if available
           - Handle renewal limits (some services limit renewal count)
           - Update Subscription.properties and Subscription.expires_at for
             the next renewal if needed
